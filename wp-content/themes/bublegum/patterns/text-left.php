Our purpose is to support emerging practitioners and the ideas they champion. We do this primality through our digital publication but also through other activities that include curation, events and exhibitions.</p>

    <p>Bubblegum Club recently transitioned from a for-profit company to operating as part of the Bubblegum Foundation. This shift reflects our deep commitment to supporting cultural production in a way that prioritises artistic integrity, community, and long-term impact over commercial imperatives.</p>
