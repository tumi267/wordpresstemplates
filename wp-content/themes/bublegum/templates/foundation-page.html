            <p>Bubblegum Club is a cultural organisation that was established in Johannesburg in 2015 and has been based in Geneva since 2025. Our purpose is to support emerging practitioners and the ideas they champion. We do this primarily through our digital publication but also through other activities that include curation, events and exhibitions.</p>

            <p>Bubblegum Club recently transitioned from a for-profit company to operating as part of the Bubblegum Foundation. This shift reflects our deep commitment to supporting cultural production in a way that prioritises artistic integrity, community, and long-term impact over commercial imperatives.</p>

            <p>In 2015, Jamal Nxedlana and Lex Trickett founded Bubblegum Club—a creative platform fuelled by the transformative potential of art and culture. Based in South Africa, the name pays tribute to the avant-garde electronic Bubblegum Music genre of the 1980s. Despite the global impact of South African music, dance, art and fashion, a self-limiting mindset prevailed in post-colonial South Africa. With a shared vision, the founders joined forces with like-minded creative individuals to establish a platform dedicated to nurturing diverse creative voices and talents.</p>

            <!-- wp:paragraph -->
            <p>At its inception, BubblegumClub was a small online platform that aimed to shine a light on those often overlooked by mainstream media, with a storytelling approach that combined insightful profiles, articles, cover features and video segments amplifying noteworthy artistic work. The platform became a vibrant hub of thought-provoking content and cutting-edge artistic expressions—a springboard for young talents to showcase their work and connect with others who shared their passion.</p>

            <!-- wp:paragraph -->
            <p>Over time, BubblegumClub’s influence grew beyond the digital realm. We launched Bubblegum Foundation, organising residencies and exhibitions for emerging artists, mentorship and exchange programs for young fashion designers and pop-up events bringing together artists, creatives and art enthusiasts. These initiatives fostered a sense of belonging and gained recognition for their inclusive nature, which led to partnerships with cultural institutions, galleries and brands further expanding our impact and reaching a wider audience. Today, we remain a trusted source for exploring emerging trends and amplifying marginalised voices.</p>

        <p>Along with this substantial online presence, we
            regularly partner with brands and organisations
            interested in engaging with young creative audiences.
            We have made original content for brands such as
            Birkenstock, Spotify, Adidas, Cie Gilles Jobin and
            collaborated on projects with Wikipedia, Pro Helvetia
            Johannesburg, Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, Goethe
            Institute and Afropunk Festival. As art creators, we
            work on independent projects with museums and
            galleries. Our curatorial projects include working with
            Kampnagel and assisting on African Mobilities at
            Architekturmuseum der TU München. We have
            exhibited our work at Unseen and No Man’s Art Gallery,
            and have been featured as part of Aperture’s annual
            summer Open in New York.</p>
