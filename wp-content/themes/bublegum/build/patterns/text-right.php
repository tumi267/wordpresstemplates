    <p>In 2015, Jamal Nxedlana and Lex Trickett founded Bubblegum Club—a creative platform fuelled by the transformative potential of art and culture. Based in South Africa, the name pays tribute to the avant-garde electronic Bubblegum Music genre of the 1980s. Despite the global impact of South African music, dance, art and fashion, a self-limiting mindset prevailed in post-colonial South Africa. With a shared vision, the founders joined forces with like-minded creative individuals to establish a platform dedicated to nurturing diverse creative voices and talents.</p>

    <p>At its inception, BubblegumClub was a small online platform that aimed to shine a light on those often overlooked by mainstream media, with a storytelling approach that combined insightful profiles, articles, cover features and video segments amplifying noteworthy artistic work. The platform became a vibrant hub of thought-provoking content and cutting-edge artistic expressions—a springboard for young talents to showcase their work and connect with others who shared their passion.</p>

    <p>Over time, BubblegumClub’s influence grew beyond the digital realm. We launched Bubblegum Foundation, organising residencies and exhibitions for emerging artists, mentorship and exchange programs for young fashion designers and pop-up events bringing together artists, creatives and art enthusiasts. These initiatives fostered a sense of belonging and gained recognition for their inclusive nature, which led to partnerships with cultural institutions, galleries and brands further expanding our impact and reaching a wider audience. Today, we remain a trusted source for exploring emerging trends and amplifying marginalised voices.</p>
